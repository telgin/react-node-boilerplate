# react-node-boilerplate
Simple client/server boilerplate for getting started quickly. This is a slimmer version of create-react-app + a simple server side.

## What?
Client: modified version of create-react-app

Server: express

## Commands
Webpack dev server: cd client, npm run start, localhost:3000 // proxies to server anyways

Server: cd client, npm run start 

Build client: cd client, npm run build, cd ../server, npm run start, localhost:8080
